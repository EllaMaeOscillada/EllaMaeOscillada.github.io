<h3> About me: </h3>
<p> <strong> Hi, my name is Ella and I am an aspiring artist. </strong> 
I have a lot of hobbies - I <br> mean like <em> a lot </em>. Starting from 
reading a bunch of webnovels, manhwas, manhwa <br> and manga... I also manifested 
the love for writing. Then, I discovered digital art <br> when I reached Senior
High School, became interested with it, practiced, and <br> eventually was able
to become proficient enough to open my own commissions.  <p>

<h3> <em>"Work Overload? Remember. One step at a time." </em></h3>
<cite> The motto I always tell myself when I get overwhelmed </cite>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Singing is my passion too.</strong>Whenever and wherever, if I felt like
I wanted to sing,<br>I would open my phone,record my voice and listen. It is
something that will never <br> change about me. </p>
<p>Lastly, <strong> games are my stress reliever </strong>. From time to time,
when everything <br>becomes too much, I play <em> genshin impact </em> and 
<em> otome games. </em> </p>
<h3> Other Info: </h3>
<p><em>Nickname:</em> Ella <br><br>
<em>Course:</em> BMMA (Bachelor of Multimedia Arts)<br><br>
 <em>Did you choose this course? Yes / No:</em> Yes <br><br>
<em>Why Yes? </em> Video editing became my passion back in Senior High School and once I found <br>out
 that a course specializing on Multimedia Arts exists, I pondered a lot and decided that<br> I would take the course that I would surely enjoy and earn money at the same time. <br><br>
<em>I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others:</em> I had no experience with programming <br>
except Flowgorithm and Python Introduction in PROGCON. Gaming on the other hand is <br>of course something I have experienced a lot. <br><br>
<em>Goals in life / pangarap sa buhay:</em> To give my family a better life. Buy them a good house<br>
 and help my little sister graduate. And then of course, to be able to create the characters,<br> maybe even movies, and stories on my own or with a reliable team to share. <br>
 And then hopefully, will be able to travel the world.<br><br>
